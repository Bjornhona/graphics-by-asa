I created it in InDesign and improved the photos in Photoshop so that they would go well with the basic green colors of the company logo and identity. The original text I had to reduce to fit the 12 pages limit and I also improved it to become more selling. The brochure I developed during the ongoing Project and I updated the photos along the way. The company printed it in different versions, a lighter version to catch the interest of possible buyers and then the above exposed for anyone that asked to receive further information about the project.",
