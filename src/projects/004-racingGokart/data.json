    "text": "This video I created in SolidWorks, a 3D CAD design software that manage product data and dimensions of the final product. The purpose was to create and present a video showing the design of an assembly of a Racing Go-cart. I first modeled the Go-cart parts, then added them in an assembly and ended animating the steering process. The assembly worked well also in the analytical tests I made in the same program and the final drawings of all the trace parts could then be created for its manufacturing.",
