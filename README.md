# GRAPHICS BY Ã…SA - My Personal Portfolio - Graphics for Your Business

This project showcases my past and present projects, giving a good understanding of my development from a well experienced UX/UI Designer and then evolving into a Senior Frontend Developer. Here you can find my resume to download and some shared experiences in my personal blog. Feel free to contact me using my contact form. I created this homepage in Javascript with React framework. Styling in plain SCSS and of course all graphics are my own.

## Project created with React

While clicking through my pages you will notice how fast you can watch all of my projects and this is all thanks to the quick linking of React. React uses Client-side routing, and because of this travelling from one page to another is way faster.

## Performance optimization

All images and videos are optimized and reduced in size but without losing too much in quality.

## How to start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is then ready to be deployed.

## Deployment

This app is deployed in GitHub at [https://github.com/Bjornhona/graphics-by-asa](https://github.com/Bjornhona/graphics-by-asa)
